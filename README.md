# Netflix Data Science Analysis

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix
Movies and TV Shows dataset. The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing
values, descriptive statistics, and visualizations to uncover trends related to
content type, release year, ratings, genres, and country-wise distribution.

The project demonstrates practical data science techniques for understanding and
extracting insights from real-world datasets.
